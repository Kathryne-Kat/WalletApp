# How it Works

The Walletapp is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building
userinterfaces. The app allows users to manage their finances by creating
accounts, adding bank accounts or credit cards, and tracking their transactions.

The app is organized into components, with each component responsible for a
specific part of the user interface. The components are written in JavaScript
and JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like
code within your JavaScript code.

The app also uses a number of third-party libraries, including:

- React Router for routing
- React Redux for state management
- Styled Components for styling
- Axios for making HTTP requests
